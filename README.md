# Just2Train

An app designed to get you to train hard

### To make it work

Just participate in an event or create one. [Enjoy the magic !](http://just2train.herokuapp.com)

### What it does:

This app is and will be your guide

* Just visit the website (again (http://just2train.herokuapp.com))
* Don't forget to create your user account (otherwise your experience will be pretty limited)
* Navigate, dive in, but most importantly: create a ****** event (just to know what it feels like to be [THE BOSS](https://gph.is/18tNrRq))
* Try to checkout out already existing events
* Meditate, eat a banana

### What is doesn't do

- Pancakes, sorry but what where you expecting? (But you still can bring pancakes to your event, or a beer, just sayin')
